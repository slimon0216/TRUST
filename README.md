# TRUST
This is the code for [**TRUST: Triangle Counting Reloaded on GPUs**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08053.pdf).


## Our method
Our implementation is in the branch `ours`. We only modified the implementation in `Without-graph-partition/TC.cu`. We also remove some redundant code and comments, and formatting the code.

Please checkout to that branch:
```bash
git checkout ours
```

Everything else remains the same. Please follow the guideline below.


## Organization
The code of TRUST has two version: without graph partition for small graph and without graph partition for large graph. Preprocess include the code for preprocessing. Following the step to test the TRUST.

## Environment 
CUDA Toolkit 10.2;
g++ 7.4.0;
MPICH-3.3

## Prerpocess
In Preprocessing step, use 

    $ cd Preprocess
    $ ./compile.sh 

compile the code and we will get three files: fromDirectToUndirece, preprocess and partition.
This corresponds to following three step:

1. **fromDirectToUndirect** transform the directed graph to undirected graph, delete the duplicate edges and self loops and remove orphan vertices. It take file name as input and will generate undirected graph `1.mmio`.
For example:

    `$ ./fromDirectToUndirect cit-Patents.txt`

The format of `cit-Patents.txt` should be edge list.

2. **preprocess** will do the orientation and reordering and generate the CSR format of graph. It will take `1.mmio` as input and generate two file `begin.bin` and `adjacent.bin`

3. **partition** use hash to partition the graph. To see detail of partition usage, you can read the `Dataset/Cit-Patents/partition.sh`

## Dataset
In folder `Dataset/Cit-Patents/` we give a example of download Cit-Patents graph and preprocessing it.
Run it by

    $ cd Dataset/Cit-Patents/
    $ ./get+preprocess.sh

For the large graph and input file only include edge list, we recommend use preprocess code in `Preprocess/speedupIO`.

For partition, run 

    $./partition.sh 2
    
There are one input arguments `n`, it represent the partition number, we will partition graph into `n*n` pieces

## Compile and Run code
**Before compile the code, you should modify the `Makefile` to match your architecture.**
**The current settings, `--gpu-architecture=compute_70 --gpu-code=sm_70`, are tailored for the V100 environment used in the paper.**
For small graph, we don't partition the graph. 
Compile the code:

    $ cd Without-graph-partition/
    $ make

Run the code:

    $ mpirun -n 1 ./trianglecounting.bin ../Dataset/Cit-Patents/ 1 1024 1024 1

The input arguments is 
1. input graph folder 
2. number of GPUs
3. number of thread per block 
4. number of block 
5. chuncksize

The output arguments is
1. graph folder 
2. vertex count
3. edge count
4. triangle counts
5. times
6. TEPS rate

For the large graph, partition is required.

Compile the code:

    $ cd With-graph-partition/
    $ make

Run the code:

    $ mpirun -n 8 ./trianglecounting.bin ../Dataset/Cit-Patents/ 8 1024 1024 1 2


The input arguments is 
1. input graph folder 
2. number of GPUs should be m
3. number of thread per block 
4. number of block 
5. chuncksize
6. partition number `n`

The output arguments is
1. graph folder 
4. triangle counts
5. min times
6. max times
